	v0.1 - 21/01/2015

		To begin with, the implementation of extracting a page number and offset
		from a given logical address is to be added. The creation of the class
		'LogicalAddress' was implemented to achieve this. In addition, the JUnit
		testing class 'LogicalAddressTest' was also created to ensure that the
		method of extracting page number and offset was correct.

	v0.2 - 22/01/2015 - 26/01/2015

		The page table and physical memory were created, along with the body of
		the memory manager. The system was now able to simulate the translation
		and reading of various addresses without the use of the TLB, which was
		to come later.

	v0.3 - 27/01/2015

		The TLB is implemented with a FIFO algoritm, while a Random algorithm
		was also implemented, it is yet to be tested. The TLB has been added to
		the simulator, so now we have a basic virtual memory manager created.
		There were issues with adding the TLB to the manager, due to how it was
		structured in its abscence, this has since been fixed however.
